# How to Add a Blazor File Manager to the Blazor Server App?

The [Blazor File Manager](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-file-manager?utm_medium=listing&utm_source=github-examples&utm_campaign=blazor-file-manager-github-examples) is a graphical user interface component for managing the file system. This component also provides easy navigation for browsing folders to select a file or folder from the file system. This quick-start Blazor server app project will help you to learn how to configure and add the Blazor File Manager to it. You will also learn how to manages the file system that allows users to perform most common file operations like accessing, editing, and sorting files or folders.

## Features and Benefits

### Customizable layout design

The Blazor File Manager UI consists of toolbar, navigation pane, and content pane sections through which the files or folders in the file system can be accessed and managed. The complete layout can be customized with features like right-to-left alignment, enabling or disabling the toolbar and navigation pane, and switching between views.

### Toolbar

The toolbar contains the list of tools for performing various operations like file upload or download and view switching. The toolbar can also be configured to add any custom functionality to be performed with the file system.

### Navigation pane

The navigation pane allows quick and direct access to a file or folder in a file system where the entire folder hierarchy is listed using a tree view. This can be made visible or hidden as needed.

### Content pane

The content pane displays the files and folders in the file system. The files in the content pane can be displayed in either large icons view or details view.

### File operations

The Blazor File Manager component includes all the common [operations](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/file-manager/file-operations/?utm_medium=listing&utm_source=github-examples&utm_campaign=blazor-file-manager-github-examples) needed for managing a file system. It includes copy, move, upload, download, edit, create, delete, and sort.

### File upload and download

The Blazor File Manager component allows the easy uploading and downloading of files in a file system.

### Sorting

Files and folders in the file system can be sorted in either ascending or descending order simply by clicking the column header. Files and folders can be sorted based on name, date created, size, etc.

### Searching

The Blazor File Manager component contains built-in searching functionality that allows you to search for and access a file or folder in the current path and its child folders.

### Moving files and folders with drag and drop

Files and folders can be moved within the file system by dragging and dropping them. [Drag-and-drop](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/file-manager/drag-and-drop/?utm_medium=listing&utm_source=github-examples&utm_campaign=blazor-file-manager-github-examples) support can be turned on or off in the Blazor File Manager.

### Access control restriction

The Blazor File Manager provides support to restrict access to files and folders by defining a set of rules for them. Only authorized users will be able to access them.

### Restrict file types on upload

You can specify the types of files that can be uploaded in the Blazor File Manager. Other file types will be restricted on upload.

### Multiple-file selection

The Blazor File Manager component has built-in support for the selection of multiple files or folders. [Multiple-file selection](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/file-manager/multiple-file-selection/?utm_medium=listing&utm_source=github-examples&utm_campaign=blazor-file-manager-github-examples) will be effective when a single operation like download or delete is performed over multiple files in the file system.

### Quick access menu

The Blazor File Manager component has context menu support to list the operations to be performed with the files and folders. It appears when a file or folder is right-clicked. The context menu items can be customized according to user preference.

### Localization

The text of a context menu list and the tooltips being displayed in the user interface can be localized to any supported language. The Blazor File Manager component uses a localization library (l10) to localize the text values.

### Web accessibility

* Follows [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/?utm_medium=listing&utm_source=github-examples&utm_campaign=blazor-file-manager-github-examples) best practices for implementing keyboard interaction.
* Supports right-to-left (RTL) direction for users working in right-to-left languages like Hebrew and Arabic.

### Built-in themes

The Blazor File Manager layout supports several built-in themes: Material, Bootstrap, Fabric (Office 365), and high contrast. Users can customize any one of these built-in themes or create new themes to achieve their own desired look by either simply overriding the SASS variables or using our Theme Studio application.

### Developer-friendly APIs

Developers have control over all the UI elements and behaviors of the components to provide the best experience to end users with a rich set of developer-friendly APIs.
